      <description>Just one “selfie” after a drink changed everything. Aneta decided to send the picture to Xenon Model Agency. Within two days she got a call with an invitation to create a professional model portfolio. After an amazing day spent in a studio in London, Aneta is now ready to embark on her career as a model.</description>

      <description>She has definitely got an eye for detail! Since her early years she has loved creating beautiful art and the seeing the joy that this brings to other people. Aneta was spotted at the age of 6 by her teacher and encouraged to attend extra art classes outside of school hours, to further develop her talent. This love of studying and creating art continued throughout her formal education over the last 16 years.</description>
