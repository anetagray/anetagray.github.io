      <description>She has definitely got an eye for detail! Since her early years she has loved creating beautiful art and the seeing the joy that this brings to other people. Aneta was spotted at the age of 6 by her teacher and encouraged to attend extra art classes outside of school hours, to further develop her talent. This love of studying and creating art continued throughout her formal education over the last 16 years.</description>

      <description>Aneta was born in a small Slovakian village called Studenec, surrounded by a loving family, nature, animals and art. She is inspired by new people, places, cultures, various art forms, and loves the opportunity for adventure that travel brings. Because of this she decided to move far from home. Currently living in sunny Brighton, United Kingdom, this hunger for adventure has brought her a whole range of experiences, connections and friendships she never would have thought possible.</description>
